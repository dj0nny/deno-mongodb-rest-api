## :rocket: Getting started

### Download

Clone the repository using **Git**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dj0nny/deno-mongodb-rest-api.git
```
Or download [here](https://github.com/dj0nny/deno-mongodb-rest-api/archive/develop.zip).

### Install

There is no installation this time. üò±

All package are decentralized and they are imported via URL.

### Usage

You must have Deno installed on your local machine. For more info: https://deno.land/.

Before starting rename the `.env.example` file in `.env` and fills it.

Compared to Node.js, Deno provides by default a more secure protection when you run the script. For running correctly this program, you must explicitly grant the permissions:

`deno run --allow-net --allow-write --allow-read --allow-plugin --unstable --allow-env src\index.ts`
